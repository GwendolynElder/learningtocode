  <h1>Gwendolyn Elder</h1>
  <p><em>Digital Product Designer</em></p>
  </center>
  <p>Throughout my decade of experience in higher education, I’ve built curriculum and courses based on university and student needs that were some of the highest-rated courses in our department, I leveraged my passion and talent for developing
    others into training and leadership roles, delivering training programs, systems training, and adding research, data analysis, and user needs to the mix. My entire career has prepared me for a transition into UX, where I can bring sensibilities
    of research, strategy, and creativity to life.  </p>
  <p>I truly believe that all digital products are educational in nature, as we teach customers our value proposition, we help them understand the benefit that only our product or service can offer, and we encourage them to dive deeper in their
    use, experience, and investment. Developing people and digital products in this way is what gets me out of bed each morning, and learning how to make things useful, relatable, and of value to users is how I grow and develop myself daily.  </p>
  <p>In my free time, I love to travel and have lived on three of the seven continents as well as visiting multiple countries throughout my adult life. I am a reader, a writer, a wife, a fur-baby mama, and a curious learner.</p>
